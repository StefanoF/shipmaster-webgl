## What's inside
In this mini-project i experiment with:
- loop animation of simple primitive objects;
- collision detection;
- move 3d objects with mouse (click and movement);
- camera, light and scene basics;

## Inspiration
I take advantage of this tutorial by edit this simple game: https://github.com/yakudoo/TheAviator
